## FAQ

**Whats the difference between this and Medoo?**

Not much - they are basically the equivalant - However, SuperSQL is slightly more advanced.

* Response class - SuperSQL has a response class to access crucial information, such as errors
* Cache - SuperSQL caches queries to re-execute them later
* Helper - SuperSQL comes with a helper class, with helper functions, while meedoo has it built right in.
* Simple API - SuperSQL comes with a simple api for simple queries to increase performance. No need to go overkill for something as simple as `SELECT * FROM table`
* Smaller & lightweight - SuperSQL is smaller than medoo
* Development - SuperSQL's code is well structured and it is commented - so you can understand it more
* Medoo has source mapping - SuperSQL doesnt support it yet
