The most lightest, efficient and most powerful php sql database framework. Allows you to quickly and securely develop anything using sql databases.

## Purpose

1. To provide a very fast and efficient way to edit sql databases.
2. To provide an easy method of access.

### Main Features

1. Very small - 27.4KB one file (Unminified, `dist/SuperSQL.php`. Minified version: 12.4KB)
2. Simple and easy - Very easy to learn. SuperSQL was designed to be easy and simple, to the ability that a noob can use it.
3. Compatability - Supports all major SQL databases
4. Efficiency - This module was built with speed and efficiency in mind.
5. Complexity - This module allows you to make all kinds of complex queries.
6. Security - This module prevents SQL injections, so hackers bye bye!
7. Availability - This module is FREE. Licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/ThreeLetters/SuperSQL/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Usage
You may either

1. Use the built file ([/dist/SuperSQL.php](https://github.com/ThreeLetters/SuperSQL/blob/master/dist/SuperSQL.php) - preferred)
2. Use the library (Autoload all in `SuperSQL/`, we also provide a [simple loader](https://github.com/ThreeLetters/SuperSQL/blob/master/autoload.php))
3. Use the [composer package](https://packagist.org/packages/threeletters/supersql) (`composer require threeletters/supersql`)

```php
new SuperSQL($dsn,$user,$pass);
```
```php
use SuperSQL\SuperSQL;

// MySql setup
$host = "localhost";
$db = "test";
$user = "root";
$pass = "1234";

$dsn = "mysql:host=$host;port=3306;dbname=$db;charset=utf8";
$SuperSQL = new SuperSQL($dsn,$user,$pass);
```

```php
use SuperSQL\SQLHelper;

// MySql setup
$host = "localhost";
$db = "test";
$user = "root";
$pass = "1234";

$SuperSQL = SQLHelper::connect($host, $db, $user,$pass);
```
```php
$result = $SuperSQL->select("test",[],[
    "condition" => 12345,
    "[||][&&]" => [
        "something" => "value",
        "anotherthing" => "val"
    ]
]); // SELECT * FROM `test` WHERE `condition` = 12345 OR (`something` = 'value' AND `anotherthing` = 'val')

if (!$result->error()) {
foreach ($result as $val) { // NOTE, $result is NOT an array
    echo $val;
}
} else {
echo json_encode($result->error());
}
```

## Build
To build this library, you need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). Then execute `builder.js`

> node builder.js

It will build to `/dist/SuperSQL*.php`

## FAQ

**Whats the difference between this and Medoo?**

While on the most basic level, SuperSQL and Medoo are the same, they are quite different.

* Response class - SuperSQL has a response class to access crucial information, such as errors
* Helper - SuperSQL comes with a helper class, with helper functions, while meedoo has it built right in.
* Smaller & lightweight - SuperSQL is smaller than medoo
* Development - SuperSQL's code is well structured and it is commented - so you can understand it more
* SuperSQL is faster - Using xdebug, we found that superSQL's parser is faster than medoo's. (x1000,100%)
* SuperSQL is less confusing. (EG, ``SELECT * FROM `table` `` is just `$SuperSQL->select('table');`)
* SuperSQL has more features - (EG, multi-querying, dynamic responses)

**How fast is superSQL compared to Medoo?**

[speed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13282284/30243699-b4c76e32-957d-11e7-9bdb-ec96f53816b1.png)

**Whats the difference between this an SlickInject?**

SuperSQL uses the same concepts and design as slickInject. However, supersql is much much more advanced.

**Eww, why PDO**

PDO is much better than mysqli. Main reason because it supports so many different databases. Also, PDO is easier.

**How did you make the documentation?**

The nice documentation was created using [Slate - Check it out](https://github.com/lord/slate).
